Heavily inspired by https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles

After cloning and entering into the repo, running `./bootstrap.sh` will set things up.  It will make copies of many of the files in your `~/` directory.

If `~/.extra` exists (or anything beginning with `.extra`), it will be sourced along with the other files.
